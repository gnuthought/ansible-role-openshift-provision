openshift-provision
=========

An Ansible role for provisioning resources within OpenShift clusters.

This role provides comprehensive OpenShift cluster resource provisioning
using a single declarative variable structure or using the
`openshift_provision` Ansible module provided.

Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install https://github.com/gnuthought/ansible-role-openshift-provision/archive/master.tar.gz#/openshift-provision
```

Requirements
------------

OCP 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, & 3.9
ansible 2.4+

A host with the `oc` command to run from.

Usage
-----

The `openshift_provision` role may be run from any host with the `oc` command
and access to the cluster with appropriate privileges to provision the
resources specified in the calling playbook. For provisioning base cluster
configuration it is recommended to run `openshift_provision` from a master node
immediately following OpenShift cluster installation. For provisioning
application projects and resources it is recommended to use another host,
authenticating with a service account token. Username with password login is
supported with the `openshift_login` module. The host processing the
`openshift_provision` role must have the `oc` command and the Python JMESPath
module for supporting the `json_query` ansible filter.

If this role is called with a `openshift_resource_definition` file variable, it will read
variables from the file specified.

Role Variables
--------------

* `oc_cmd_base` - The base `oc` command. Defaults to "oc", but can be set to
  specify a different path or add custom options

* `openshift_clusters` - List of openshift cluster definitions as described
  below

* `openshift_cluster_provision_post_tasks` - List of ansible tasks files to
  include after processing provision for each cluster

* `openshift_cluster_provision_pre_tasks` - List of ansible tasks files to
  include immediately before processing provision for each cluster

* `openshift_connection_certificate_authority` - Path to file containing
  signing certificate for OpenShift server. This option may also be set within
  `openshift_clusters` as `connection.certificate_authority`

* `openshift_connection_insecure_skip_tls_verify` - If set to "true" then
  disable SSL/TLS checks when connectiong to OpenShift server. This option
  may also be set within `openshift_clusters` as
  `connection.insecure_skip_tls_verify`

  cluster. Should by of the form "https://master.example.com:8443". This option
  may also be set within `openshift_clusters` as `connection.server`

* `openshift_connection_token` - OpenShift user token. This option may also be
  set within `openshift_clusters` as `connection.token`

* `openshift_login_username` - Login username. Use of a connection token is
  preferred to providing a username and password. This option may also be
  set within `openshift_clusters` as `login.username`

* `openshift_login_password` - Login password. Use of a connection token is
  preferred to providing a username and password. This option may also be
  set within `openshift_clusters` as `login.password`

* `openshift_resource_path` - Default list of directories to search for file
  paths in cluster and project `cluster_resources` and `resources` definitions.
  Default to playbook directory

* `openshift_resource_definition` (DEPRECATED) - Path to variable definitons
  to dynamically load with `include_vars`. Use of standard Ansible variable
  mechanisms is recommended

* `user_groups` (DEPRECATED) - List of groups to create across all clusters,
  use of `groups` under `openshift_clusters` is preferred

### `openshift_clusters[*]`

List of OpenShift cluster definitions

* `connection` - OpenShift connection parameters, defined to match `oc` command
  line including `server`, `certificate_authority`, `insecure_skip_tls_verify`,

  valid OpenShift command line login session

* `login` - Credentials for login to the OpenShift cluster, `username` and
  `password`

* `openshift_host_env` - String or array of strings specifying hostnames. The
  cluster resources will only be provisioned if this variable is not set or if
  `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` equals a value in
  `openshift_host_env`

  be cluster level resources. Resources may be specified by a file path
  or inline OpenShift resource definition. If a file path is used it will be
  found using the value of `resource_path`. If the filename ends in ".j2"
  then it will be processed as a Jinja2 template.

  by relative file path under `cluster_resources` and `resources`, defaults
  to value of `openshift_resource_path`

* `resources` - List of OpenShift resource definitions, these should be
  project level resources that define the namespace. Normally project resources
  should appear within `projects`, but sometimes specific ordering of resource
  creation may be desired. Resources are defined in the same manner as
  `cluster_resources`

  `cluster_resources` is preferred

* `cluster_resource_quotas` (DEPRECATED) - List of cluster resource quota
  definitions. Use of `cluster_resources` is preferred

* `cluster_roles` (DEPRECATED) - List of OpenShift cluster role definitions.
  Use of `cluster_resources` is preferred

### `openshift_clusters[*].cluster_resources`

Cluster resources are the first items processed in provisioning. This is a
list of OpenShift resource definitions that are created/updated using the `oc`
command. The default action is `oc apply`, but may be overridden by setting
"metadata.annotations.openshift-provision/action" on the resource. Values for
action may be:

* `apply` - Use `oc apply` to create or update the resource

* `create` - Use `oc create` to create the resource. If the resource already
  exists then no action is taken

* `delete` - Use `oc delete` to delete the resource. If the resource does not
  exist then no action is taken

* `patch` - Use `oc patch` to update the resource. If the resource does not
  exist then an error is thrown

* `replace` - Use `oc replace` to update the resource. If the resource does not
  exist then it is created with `oc create`

Besides the field `action` all other fields follow OpenShift standards. All
resources must define `metadata.name`.

### `openshift_clusters[*].cluster_role_bindings`

List of cluster role assignments. Each entry is a dictionary containing:

* `role` - Name of role managed. This is *not* the name name of rolebinding,
  but rather the name of the role referenced by the role binding. Assignment

  name of role bindings. Required

* `users` - List of user names that should be granted access to this cluster
  role. Optional

* `groups` - List of group names that should be granted access to this cluster
  role. Optional

  `name`

* `name` - Template name to process, mutually exclusive with `file`

* `namespace` - Namespace in which the template specified in `name` is found,
  default is this project

* `parameters` - Dictionary of parameters to pass to the template. Optional

* `action` - Action to process template output, values for `action` are the same

* `imagestreams` - Names of imagestreams to create in the project. This
   parameter is meant to allow for simple creation of imagestreams such as are
   created by `oc create imagestream NAME`. For more sophisticated imagestream
   creation a full definition may be provided within `resources`

* `join_pod_network` - Name of target project to which this project network
  should be joined for use with multi-tenant SDN

  Resources may be specified by a file path or inline OpenShift resource
  definition. If a file path is used it will be found using the value of
  `resource_path`. If the filename ends in ".j2" then it will be processed as a
  Jinja2 template.

* `role_bindings` - Role bindings to apply to project to grant or revoke user
  and group access to roles, described below

* `service_accounts` - List of service accounts to provision within this
  project. Each entry is a name of a service account to create. Service

  `resources` is preferred to create ResourceQuota objects

### `openshift_clusters[*].projects[*].process_templates`

List of templates to process to manage resources within project. The result
items list from the processed template is then parsed and each resource in
that list is processed by `openshift_provision`.

### `openshift_clusters[*].projects[*].resources`

This is a list of OpenShift resource definitions that are created/updated in
a project using the `oc` command. The default action is `oc apply`, but may be
overridden by setting the annotation "openshift-provision/action" within the
resource. Values for `action` are the same as described above for
`openshift_clusters[*].cluster_resources`. The annotation
"openshift-provision/patch-type" may be used with the "patch" action.

### `openshift_clusters[*].projects[*].role_bindings`

List of project role assignments. Each entry is a dictionary containing:

* `role` - Name of role managed. This is *not* the name name of rolebinding,
  but rather the name of the role referenced by the role binding. Assignment
  and removal of roles uses `oc policy` commands which do not specify the
  name of role bindings. Required

* `users` - List of user names that should be granted access to this project
  role. Optional

* `groups` - List of group names that should be granted access to this project

List of OpenShift project resources to create. Declaration is the same as
specified above for `openshift_clusters[*].projects[*].resources` with the
addition that each entry here must specify `metadata.namespace` to specify
the target project for the resource.
